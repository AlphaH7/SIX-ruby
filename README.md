  The computer will generate a six digit sequence (eg- ascdsd) and you have to guess 1 alphabet, each at a time.
  Guessing 6 alphabets gets you a "SIX" and a new sequence is generated.
  A basic Guessing game coded in Ruby & shoes(GUI Toolkit). Windows & mac apps are exported using shoes.

  Development mode displays the generated random alphabet for algorithm testing..
